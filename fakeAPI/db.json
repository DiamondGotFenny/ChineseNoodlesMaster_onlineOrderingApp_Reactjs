However, the meat in Lanzhou beef noodles is really low, and when I ate beef noodles in Zunyi, I could still eat a few pieces of meat, but the meat in Lanzhou noodles is really gone after a quick glance. I think the reason why it tastes so good to people outside of Gansu province is that the soup base is made from beef bones, after all the noodles I've eaten in other provinces are mostly just a spoonful of boiled water. If the beef noodle soup is made from beef bones, it will cost you two yuan more than in other restaurants.",

In the case of old braised noodles in Nanjing, a spoonful of simmering marinade is usually placed in a bowl, then mixed with the noodle soup, and the noodles are then picked up and topped with the toppings. When you stir the noodles with chopsticks, the noodles are immediately colored and the aroma becomes even more intense.",
