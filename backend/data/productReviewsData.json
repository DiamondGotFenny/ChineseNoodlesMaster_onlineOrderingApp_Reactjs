        "comment": "Tasty but not amazing. I thought it was similar to Guizhou's beef noodles, and I thought I had the taste of Guizhou. However, the meat in Lanzhou beef noodles is really low, and when I ate beef noodles in Zunyi, I could still eat a few pieces of meat, but the meat in Lanzhou noodles is really gone after a quick glance. I think the reason why it tastes so good to people outside of Gansu province is that the soup base is made from beef bones, after all the noodles I've eaten in other provinces are mostly just a spoonful of boiled water. If the beef noodle soup is made from beef bones, it will cost you two yuan more than in other restaurants.",
